# Made from Tauri's React/Typescript template

## What?

A basic client to view Wallpaper Engine videos.

## Why?

If a wallpaper is removed from Wallpaper Engine and you have it downloaded, it will automatically be removed from your PC when you login to steam.
This happened to me multiple times so I decided to move my folders out of workshop folder and into a backup. But then I had no convenient way to browse.
So I made this client.

## Functionality

- Can select a directory where your wallpapers are
- Can browse video wallpapers, and one-click open those files in your default video player.

## Todos
- cache results from rust
- pagination on results
- make sidebar background full height
- linux support
